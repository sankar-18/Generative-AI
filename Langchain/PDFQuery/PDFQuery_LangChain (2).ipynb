              "' \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBUDGET SPEECH  \\n2023-2024 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n [PART -A] \\nHon‘ble Speaker sir and members of this august House,      \\n  \\n1. Today, I am present before all of you as the Finance Minister to \\npresent the budget for the year 2023 -24 in the Delhi Assembly. I feel \\nvery grateful, honored and humbled for this responsibility. I would \\nhave been more happy if this budget was presented by our respected \\nformer Deputy CM Shri Manish Sisodia ji as always. This is the 9th \\nbudget of this government and my first as the Finance Minister. I \\nwould like to thank the honorable Chief Minister from the bottom of \\nmy heart for giving me this opportunity t o present the budget for the 2 \\ncrore people of Delhi. We all know that the Budget is not just a \\ndocument of numbers and announcements, it is a  manifestation of \\nthe hopes and aspirations of every aam-aadmi.  \\n \\nThis budget has been prepared with the pure and t rue spirit of public \\nwelfare and enhancement of happiness in the life of every person of \\nDelhi. While preparing the budget, I am reminded of the immortal \\nmessage of the Upanishads:  \\n \\nSarve bhavantu sukhinah, Sarve santu niramayah  \\nSarve bhadrani pashyantu , Ma kashid dukh bhag bahvet.  \\n \\n2. Under the visionary leadership of Hon‘ble Chief Minister, Delhi has \\nseen unprecedented progress over the last eight years. Today the \\nword ―Delhi model‖ evokes a ray of new hope across the length and \\nbreadth of the country. It  stands as an assurance to the poorest of \\nthe poor that the government will provide free and world -class \\neducation and health facilities for their family. It stands as an 2 \\n assurance that in these times of unprecedented price -rise, the \\ngovernment will provid e them with free essential public services such \\nas water and 24x7 electricity. It also stands as a commitment of the \\ngovernment that works honestly and with zero -tolerance to \\ncorruption, through schemes such as doorstep delivery of 100+ \\nservices or the rec ently introduced faceless services in the transport  \\ndepartment. Here, the citizen doesn‘t have to make endless trips to \\ngovernment offices to get his work done, but the government \\nreaches out to ensure all citizens\\' needs are fulfilled in a timely and \\nefficient manner, without reliance on middlemen.  \\n \\n3. Yet another facet of the Delhi model, Speaker sir, is to fulfil the \\naspirations of our people. Delhi is a source of pride not just for the 2 \\nCrore people residing in the national capital, but for all the 140 Crore \\npeople of India. Delhi is a symbol of Indi a‘s progress and potential in \\nthe 21st century. And that is why, the face and the infrastructure of \\nDelhi matters.  \\n \\n4. Over the last eight years, the Delhi  government has completed some \\nlandmark infrastructure projects that have changed the face of Delhi. \\nThe Signature Bridge, whi ch was completed in 2018 is a source of \\npride for the people of Delhi. Phase II of the Barapullah flyover \\nconnecting Sarai Kale Khan and INA market  was also completed in \\n2018.  These projects were a symbol of endless delays and \\nineffic iencies of the past governments of Delhi.  Phase III of \\nBarapullah Flyover is expected to be completed soon. This year, \\nworks on the Ash ram flyover and underpass were also completed \\neasing out the daily commute for close to 4 lakh vehicles in Delhi. It \\ngives me tremendous pride to share that in the last eight years  the 3 \\n PWD has constructed 28 new flyovers, elevated roads and bridges \\nthat have significantly improved commute for the people of Delhi.  \\n \\n5. At the same time, this government has invested in providing modern, \\nworld class public transport for the people of Delhi. The network of \\nDelhi metro has significantly expanded and doubled in the last eight \\nyears. In the first 17 years since the construction of Delhi metro \\nstarted in 1998 and until March 2015, a tot al of 193 km of rail \\nnetwork and 143 metro stations were constructed. However, in the \\npast eight years i.e. from 2015 to 2023, the network length of Delhi \\nmetro has doubled to 390 km and so have the number of stations at \\n286. The public bus network of Delh i has also seen an \\nunprecedented expansion in this period from 5, 842 buses in 2015 to \\n7,379 buses in 2023, the highest in the history of Delhi so far.  \\n \\n6. In the budget for 2021 -22, termed as Deshbhakti budget, our \\ngovernment had announced an ambitious plan that filled the heart of \\nevery Delhiite with pride. The government had committed to install \\n500 high mast flags across the length and breadth of the city to \\ncelebrate the 75th anniversary of India‘s independence. It is with \\ntremendous pride that I share to day that the government has fulfilled \\nits promise and rightfully earned the tag of the ―city of tricolours‖. \\nRarely does one pass by any road stretch in Delhi today without \\nseeing the magnificent tricolour flying with pride in the skies of Delhi.  \\n \\n7. Speaker sir, the coming year is going to be a significant one for Delhi \\nas we will be hosting India‘s first G20 summit. The entire world‘s \\neyes are going to be on Delhi. Building on the landmark \\ninfrastructure projects initiated by the Kejriwal  government over the  4 \\n past eight years, the coming year presents a tremendous opportunity \\nfor Delhi to showcase itself as a clean, beautiful, and modern city on \\nthe global stage. Therefore, I shall be dedicating this year‘s budget \\ntowards the vision of our Hon‘ble Chief Minist er of making  \\n \\n‘Clean, Beautiful and Modern Delhi’  \\n \\nthat will be a source of pride for every Indian. We will be launching \\nthe biggest such effort in the history of Delhi, or perhaps any Indian \\ncity, for upgradation and beautification of over 1400 kms  of the entire \\nPWD road network, which forms the core network of roads in Delhi. \\nFrom repairing and recarpeting the entire network of roads and \\nfootpaths to make them pedestrian friendly, to ensuring end to end \\ngreening of unpaved areas adjoining the roads  to initiating regular \\nmechanical sweeping and washing of the entire road network, this \\nproject will transform how Delhi‘s roads look.  \\n \\n8. Besides upgradation of existing road network, our government will \\ncontinue its efforts towards modernisation of Delhi‘s transport \\nnetwork through the construction of 29 new \\nflyovers/underpasses/bridges, 3 world -class ISBTs modelled along \\nthe line of airports and Phase 4 expansion of Metro Rail network. We \\nwill be inducting a record number of 1600 modern, zero -emission \\nelect ric buses this year, which will make Delhi‘s electric bus fleet the \\nlargest among all states in India by the end  of 2023. We will also \\nbegin the installation of 1400 new and modern bus queue shelters \\n(BQS) with digital screens w ith modern Passenger Informa tion \\nSystem (PIS) will  display the  arrival time  of buses. The dream of a \\nclean and beautiful Delhi is incomplete without a clean and beautiful \\nYamuna. In the next year, we will rapidly expand the reach of the 5 \\n sewer network to all the colonies and JJ cluste rs of Delhi and \\nupgrade the capacities of our sewage treatment plants on a war \\nfooting to achieve the vision of Clean Yamuna.  \\n \\n9. Speaker sir, the three garbage mountains  of Delhi have been a dark \\nspot on Delhi‘s image for several decades now. Though the task of \\nclearing these garbage mountains falls in the domain of MCD, for the \\nsake of the people of Delhi, we will work hand in hand with the MCD \\nand provide them whatever support necessary to ensure that we see \\nthe end of Delhi‘s three garbage mountains at the earliest.  \\n \\n10. By taking all these steps , this year‘s budget with a huge outlay for \\nCapital expenditure of over ₹ 21,000 Crore towards Infrastructure \\nprojects presents a clear and a comprehensive plan to transform \\nDelhi into a ‗clean, beautiful and modern city‘ that every Indian can \\ntake pride in.  \\n \\nECONOMIC  SCENARIO  OF DELHI  \\n \\n11. Before discussing the budget proposals for the next year, I want to \\ntalk a little about Delhi\\'s economy. Delhi, besides being the capital of \\nIndia, is a major commercial and economic hub. The economic \\ngrowth of Delhi is very important, and it plays a vital role in the \\neconomic development plans of India. International trade, financial \\nservices, comme rcial development and government sectors are \\nmajor contributors to Delhi\\'s economy.  \\n \\n12. Delhi\\'s economy is now slowly emerging from the economic \\nchallenges of the Covid -19 pandemic. As a result, Delhi\\'s GSDP is \\nlikely to increase from ₹ 9,04,642 Crore  in the year 2021 -22 to ₹ 6 \\n 10,43,759 Crore in 2022 -23 at prevailing market prices - an increase \\nof 15.38 %.  \\n \\n13. I would also like to clarify that the real growth rate of Delhi\\'s GSDP in \\nthe year 2022 -23 is likely to be 9.18%. Whereas at National level, \\nthis gr owth rate is estimated to be 7.0%. This means that we are \\nagain attaining the level of pre -pandemic economic activities.  \\n \\n14. It may be noted that Delhi‘s GSDP expanded at 18.50% at current \\nprices and 9.14% at constant prices during the year 2021 -22, which \\nreflects the impact of the effective measures taken for control of \\nCOVID -19 pandemic.  \\n \\n15. The contribution of Delhi\\'s real GSDP to the national GDP is \\nestimated to increase from 3.94% in 2011 -12 to 4.09% in 2022 -23, \\nwhereas Delhi accounts for only 1.53% of the country\\'s total \\npopulation. I would like to point out that the service sector contrib utes \\nmainly to the economy of Delhi and contributes 84.84% to the Gross \\nState Value Added      at prevailing market prices, while the \\nsecondary sector contributes 12.53% and the primary sector \\ncontributes 2.63%.  \\n \\n16. Delhi\\'s per capita income is likely to increase to ₹ 4,44,768 at current \\nprices in the financial year 2022 -23. In the year 2021 -22, it was ₹ \\n3,89,529. This shows an increase of 14.18% in Delhi\\'s per capita \\nincome in 2022 -23. Delhi\\'s per capita income for the year 2022 -23 is \\nalmost 2.6 times hig her than the national average of ₹ 1,72,000.  \\n \\n17.  Speaker sir, all these numbers reflect that Delhi Government has \\nsuccessfully navigated the economic challenges imposed by the 7 \\n Covid -19 pandemic. Our government has made a major contribution \\nin improving the state of Delhi‘s economy in the last 8 years, credit \\nfor which goes to its innovative and progressive approach to \\ngovernance.  \\n \\n18. Delhi\\'s per capita income ranks third highest among all states in \\nIndia, and the highest among states with over 1 Crore populatio n. \\nDelhi also has emerged as the state with the highest minimum \\nwages in the country since Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ji came to \\npower. This shows that not only the average income of a common \\nresident of Delhi is higher than the rest of the country but  also the \\nminimum wage of the poorest people of Delhi is the highest in the \\ncountry.  This is at the heart of Delhi‘s Model of Economic \\nDevelopment, which ensures that the economic condition of the \\nmasses remain strong and people are capable to buy various  items \\naccording to their income and meet their economic needs.  \\n \\nREVISED  ESTIMATES  2022 -23 \\n \\n19. The Revised Budget Estimate for the financial year 2022 -23 is ₹ \\n72,500 Crore as against the Approved Budget Estimate of ₹ 75,800 \\nCrore . The proposed revised estimate of ₹ 72,500 Crore is 18.52% \\nhigher than the actual expenditure of ₹ 61,172 Crore in 2021 -22. The \\nRevised Estimate amounting to ₹ 72,500 Crore includes ₹ 53,296 \\nCrore for revenue expenditure and ₹ 19,204 Crore for capital \\nexpenditure.  \\n \\n20. Establishment expenditure and other committed liabilities are \\nproposed to be increased from ₹ 32,200 Crore in the Approved 8 \\n Budget Estimates for 2022 -23 to ₹ 33,800 Crore in the Revised \\nEstimates. ₹ 38,700 Crore is proposed in the Revised Estimat es for \\nschemes/projects in 2022 -23. It was ₹ 43,600 Crore in the approved \\nbudget estimate.  \\n \\nSUPPLEMENTARY  GRA NTS  SOUGHT  FOR  THE  YEAR  2022 -23 \\n \\n21. Sir, second and last batch of Supplementary Demand for Grants of ₹ \\n159.17 Crore  will be required in the Revised Estimates during the \\nyear 2022 -23. Therefore, I seek the approval of the House for the \\nSupplementary Demands for Grants.  \\n \\n22. Now, I present the Budget Estimates for the next Financial Year \\nbefore this House:  \\n \\nBUDGET  ESTIMATES  2023 -24 \\n \\n23. The total expenditure of the Government of National Capital Territory \\nof Delhi during 2014 -15 before our government came to power was ₹ \\n30,940 Crore. Our government presented the first  full budget in June \\n2015 with an estimated budget of ₹ 41,129 Crore.  \\n \\n24. It is with great pleasure that I propose a budget of ₹ 78,800 Crore for \\nthe year 2023 -24. This is almost two and a half times the expenditure \\nof ₹ 30,940 Crore in the year 2014 -15, and 8.69% higher than the \\nrevised estimates for 2022 -23. \\n \\n25. Significa ntly, the Budget Estimate of ₹ 78,800 Crore for 2023 -24 \\nincludes ₹ 56,983 Crore under Revenue expenditure and an outlay  of \\n₹ 21,817 Crore under Capital expenditure.. The share of Capital 9 \\n expenditure as part of the overall budget has also risen to 27.68% in \\nthis year‘s budget .The Capital expenditure of ₹ 21,817 Crore is \\nalmost three times the capital outlay of ₹ 7,430 Crore in 2014 -15. In \\nthe budget of ₹ 78,800 Crore, ₹ 35,100 Crore is for establishment \\nand other committed expenditure and ₹ 43,700 Crore is for \\nschemes/programmes and projects.  \\n \\n26. Speaker sir, I must mention here that the historic rise in Delhi‘s \\nbudget over the last eight years has happened despite the step -\\nmotherly treatment by the Central government in allocating Delhi‘s \\nlegitimate share from the central pool of taxes and duties. While \\nother states receive a share from 42% of all taxes collected by the \\nCentral government, Delhi‘s share from the central pool of taxes has \\nremai ned frozen at ₹ 325 Crore since 2001 -02 and until this year \\n2022 -23. This is negligible given that Delhi contributes over ₹ 1.75 \\nlakh Crore in Income tax to the Central  government every year and \\nDelhi‘s legitimate share in the central  pool of taxes is appr oximately ₹ \\n6,400 Crores.  Moreover, for the next financial year 2023 -24, the \\nCentral government has now done away with  ₹ 325 Crore as Delhi‘s \\nshare from the central pool of taxes. This is economic discrimination \\nand gross injustice to the people of Delhi.       \\n \\n27. Like several states across India, Delhi is also severely impacted \\nbecause of the termination of the GST compensation program in \\nJune 2022. It is expected that the losses in revenue will run upto ₹ \\n12,000 Crore  annually. The promise of GST leading to a buoyant \\nstate revenue hasn\\'t been realised  due to multiple reasons including \\nthe impact of the Covid -19 pandemic. The resultant gap in revenue \\ncollection can lead to a drastic reduction in expenditure for various 10 \\n developmental programs and the overall development of the National \\nCapital Territory. We have appealed to the Central Government to, \\ntherefore , continue providing compensation for the next 5 years until \\nthe GST collections achieve the 14% annual growth rat e.  \\n \\n28. The proposed budget of ₹ 78,800 Crore for the year 2023 -24 is to be \\nfinanced by ₹ 53,565 Crore from tax revenue, ₹ 1,050 Crore from \\nnon-tax revenue, ₹ 10,000 Crore from small savings loan, ₹ 622 \\nCrore from capital receipts, ₹ 3,802 Crore from GST comp ensation , ₹ \\n3,167 Crore from centrally sponsored schemes and only ₹ 1,168 \\nCrore will be funded from the grant -in-aid of the Government of India \\nand the rest from the opening balance.  \\n \\nFINANCIAL  SUPPORT  TO LOCAL  BODIES  \\n \\n29. Speaker Sir, our government will provide a total financial assistance \\nof ₹ 8,241 Crore to the local bodies in the Budget Estimates for \\n2023 -24. Of this, ₹ 2,659 Crore will be in the form of linked funds for \\nimplementation of schemes/programmes/projects by the local body, \\n₹ 2,492 Crore will be in the form of Basic Tax Assignment (BTA) and \\n₹ 2,240 Crore will be provided to the local body as part of Stamp and \\nRegistration charges and one -time parking charges.   \\n \\nThe above amount includes ₹ 850 Crore to be given as Loan to local \\nbodies.        \\n \\nCLEAN, BEAUTIFUL AND MODERN DELHI  \\n \\n30. Speaker sir, I will now present our comprehensive plan for \\ntransforming Delhi into a ‗clean, beautiful and modern city‘. When 11 \\n any Indian travels abroad, the first thing that strikes them is how \\nneat, clean and organised their roads are. They see proper road \\nmarkings, street signages and pedestrian footpaths that even \\nchildren or senior citizens or the differently abled can comfor tably \\nuse. They see an atmosphere of cleanliness with little dust or litter \\nlying around, and all of this makes them wonder, ―Why are Indian \\nroads not like this? Is this even possible in India?‖  \\n \\n31. Speaker sir, this was the exact thought behind the vision of our \\nHon‘ble Chief Minister when we initiated the pilot project for \\nredevelopment and beautification of 16 different road stretches in \\nDelhi ranging up to 8 kilometres length, along the lines of E uropean \\nroads. It was an attempt to see how different kinds of roads under \\ndifferent conditions can all be upgraded and beautified to a common, \\nglobal standard. You must have seen these road stretches across \\nDelhi – from Moti Bagh to Mayapuri, from Moolcha nd junction to \\nAshram Chowk, at Lodhi Road, at Rajghat road etc. I am glad to \\nshare that these pilot projects have been a huge success. Pictures of \\nthese pilot road stretches, many times with selfies of local residents, \\nare flooding the social media every day. These roads have become a \\ntremendous source of pride for the local residents. This successful \\ninitiative has proven what our Hon‘ble Chief Minister often says: ―it is \\npossible to do this but you need good intentions.‖  \\n \\n32. Sir, these very words will be ou r motto and our guiding light in the \\ncoming years as we launch one of the most ambitious and \\ncomprehensive plans in Delhi‘s history to transform it into a ‗clean, \\nbeautiful and modern city‘. We are launching this effort in a very \\nsignificant year when Delh i will be hosting India‘s first G20 summit. 12 \\n Keeping this in mind, I am proposing several schemes in this budget \\nwhich aim to fulfil this objective. Some of these major schemes are \\nas follows - \\ni. Upgradation and beautification of 1400 kms  of the entire PWD \\nroad network .  \\nii. Construction of 26 new flyover/underpass/ bridge in different \\nparts of Delhi . \\niii. Construction of 3 unique double -decker flyo vers in collaboration \\nwith DMRC.  \\niv. Induction of 1600 new zero -emission electric buses, including \\n100 fe eder buses . \\nv. Electrification of 57  existing bus depots of Delhi . \\nvi. Construction of 3 world -class Inter -State Bus Terminals (ISBTs), \\n2 multi -level bus depots, 2 modern bus terminals, and 9 new \\nbus depots in Delhi . \\nvii. Construction of 1400 new and modern bus queue shelters in \\nDelhi . \\nviii. Six-point  action plan for a Clean Yamuna.    \\nix. Clearing  all three garbage mountains of Delhi .     \\n \\n33. Sir, I would now like to take some time to give details of each of \\nthese schemes.  \\n \\n34. In Delhi, the responsibility for repair, maintenance and upkeep of \\nroads is divided between multiple agencies, majority lying with MCD \\n(approx. 12,703 km), NDMC (approx. 1290 km) and PWD (approx. \\n1400 km). Unfortunately, due to lack of a common vision and \\ncoordination between multiple agencies, we have often seen that \\nthe roads remain dirty with frequent sights of potholes and broken 13 \\n footpaths for pedestrians. Many of our roads also don‘t have uniform \\nsignages and road markings, or have unpaved areas adjoin ing the \\nroads with a lot of road dust that gets suspended into air due to \\nmoving vehicular traffic causing severe air pollution.  \\n \\n35. Building upon the successes of the pilot project initiated to transform \\n16 road stretches in Delhi, the government  has made a  \\ncomprehensive plan for the upgradation and beautification of 1400 \\nkm of roads under PWD, which are known as the identity of Delhi. I \\nam happy to inform that the upgradation and beautification of all \\nthese roads will be completed in the next financial year  2023 -24. \\nOur goal will be to make these roads safe, comfortable, and \\nconvenient for all users. There will be three major components of \\nthis initiative:  \\n \\n36. First: Black topping will be done on every road under jurisdiction of \\nPWD. By the end of the financial year 2023 -24, there will not be a \\nsingle road in the entire 1400 km of roads under PWD in Delhi, \\nwhich is broken or has potholes. Not only this, clean an d beautiful \\nlane marking will be done on all PWD roads. By the end of the next \\nfinancial year, the people of Delhi will see gleaming lane markings \\nand zebra crossings at traffic signals, as per international standards, \\non all PWD roads. We will also ensure  that the brightness of these \\nlane markings and zebra crossings does not fade. For this, it will be \\npainted every three months. The same entity that will carry out the \\ninitial upgradation of the road network will be in -charge of \\nmaintaining it for next 10 years, so that there is accountability.  \\n \\n37. Second: The footpaths alongside the entire 1400 km of PWD road \\nnetwork will be completely repaired and encroachments for 14 \\n pedestrians removed. Wherever there is a central verge on these \\nroads, that central verge will  be repaired. And wherever there is raw \\nor unpaved land on the side of these roads or on the footpath, trees \\nwill be planted there. I can say with great confidence that by the end \\nof the coming   financial year, not a single footpath or central verge \\nwill be left broken. Moreover, if there is even a single feet of \\nunpaved land either in the central verge or on the footpaths, then it \\nwill be covered by planting some plants or trees on it. Not only this, \\nregular cleaning of footpaths, regular watering and per iodic washing \\nof plants planted on the side of the roads and on the divider, as well \\npainting of kerbstones on the footpath and central verge, will be \\ndone. The government has prepared a comprehensive plan to make \\nand keep these structures beautiful by pai nting once every  3 \\nmonths.  \\n \\n38. Third: Mechanised road sweeping and washing of roads by modern \\nmachines will be done at regular intervals on all PWD roads to \\nensure that no dust is generated or accumulated. To achieve this, \\nwe will be procuring 70 mechanical road sweeping machines and \\n210 water -sprinkler cum anti -smog gun machines that will cover the \\nentire span of PWD roads. It will be our endeavor, that by the end of \\nthe financial year 2023 -24, every single corner of PWD roads is \\ncleaned up and no loose dust is accumulated or flying due  to the \\nmovement of vehicles. The same problem, however, exists on \\nsmaller roads that fall under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi too. \\nIn order to make all the roads in Delhi dust free, the Delhi \\ngovernment will deploy 250 water sprinkler machines integr ated with \\nanti-smog guns which will be utilized in the entire of Delhi on need \\nbasis, for overall improvement in  ambient air quality of the city. This 15 \\n scheme of government will help in substantially reducing the \\ncontribution of road dust to Delhi‘s air pol lution – which can go up to \\n35% for PM10 and 28% for PM2.5.  \\n \\n39. Speaker sir, this entire initiative of upgrading and beautifying Delhi \\nroads is being planned with a 10 year horizon and with an \\nanticipated expenditure  of ₹ 19,466 Crore. For the coming financia l \\nyear, I propose Rs 2,034 Crore for this scheme.  \\n \\n40. Apart from the upgradation  and beautification of existing roads, our \\ngovernment will also give a major push to the construction of 26 new \\nflyover/underpass/bridge projects that are in the pipeline. Out of \\nthese, 10 projects are under construction, 11 projects have been \\nsent to UTTI PEC for design approval and 5 projects are under the \\nprocess of tendering. These include some landmark projects such \\nas Barapullah Phase 3 flyover from Sarai Kale Khan to Mayur Vihar, \\nflyover from Punjabi Bagh to Raja Garden, and elevated road at \\nNajafgarh  Phirni. When completed, these \\nflyovers/underpasses/bridges will substantially shorten the daily \\ncommute of lakhs of residents and tourists in the national capital, \\nwhile also easing traffic congestion and vehicular pollution. Usually, \\nwe see that when a f lyover is constructed in other states, the \\nconstruction cost increases manifold from the start of the \\nconstruction work till its completion. But Delhi is the only state in the \\ncountry where the cost of construction of flyovers has not increased, \\nbut by wor king honestly and efficiently, the government has saved ₹ \\n536 Crore of the public.  \\n \\n       I propose ₹ 772 Crore for new flyovers/underpasses/bridge projects \\nin FY 23 -24. 16 \\n  \\n41. Our government in collaboration with DMRC is also in process to \\nconstruct three unique double decker flyovers in the capital at \\nBhajanpura to Yamuna Vihar, Azadpur to Rani Jhansi intersections, \\nand from Saket to Pul Prahaladpur. Vehicles will run on the lo wer \\ndesk of these double decker flyovers, while the Metro rail will run on \\nthe upper deck. These flyovers have been designed in such a way \\nthat it will save ₹ 121 Crore of taxpayers‘ money. I propose ₹ 320 \\nCrore for the three double -decker flyover projects  in FY 23 -24. \\n \\n42. I propose a total budget of ₹ 3,126 Crore for all the above projects of \\nroads and bridges.  \\n \\n43. Speaker sir, the hallmark of any progressive, modern city is a world \\nclass public transport network.  Former Mayor of Bogota and a major \\nthinker in th e field of Sustainable Urban Development,  Gustavo \\nPetro has also said \"A developed country is not a place where the \\npoor have cars, it‘s where the rich use public transportation.\" This \\nstatement is very important in relation to the vision of Hon‘ble Chief \\nMinister and the work done in the public transport sector of Delhi in \\nthe last eight years. If India is to be developed, then we have to \\nmodernise the public transport system of all big cities to such an \\nextent that even the rich people feel comfortable an d proud to use it.  \\n \\n44. I am happy to inform you that  in the last 8 years , we have worked to \\nstrengthen and modernize the entire public transport system in \\nDelhi. Today  we have  7,379 buses in Delhi . It is the  highest in the \\nhistory of Delhi. The se buses  ply on more than 600 bus routes in \\nDelhi. Of these, 300 are electric buses and by the end of the year \\n2023 their number will be 1900 (1800 buses 12m long and 100 17 \\n buses 9m long), reducing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions by \\napprox 1,07,000 tonnes. By the end  of the year 2023, Delhi will have \\nthe largest fleet of electric buses among all the states of India.  \\n \\n45. By the end of 2025 , Delhi will have a fleet of 10,480 buses. But our \\nvision is not limited to just increasing the number of buses, but to \\nmake it a green  mode of travel i.e. completely pollution free. \\nTherefore, by 2025, 80% of the bus fleet in Delhi i.e. 8,280 buses \\nwill be electric, making it one of the largest among all cities globally. \\nAs a result,  approx 4.6 lakh tonnes of Carbon Dioxide ( CO2) \\nemissio ns will be reduced every year.  This will help in  significantly  \\nreducing pollution levels in Delhi.  \\n \\n46. Sir, it is often lamented that last -mile connectivity is the biggest \\nproblem of Delhi‘s public transport system, which includes both \\nmetro and buses. Many  people choose to buy private vehicles \\nbecause they do not find a convenient or affordable first - or last -mile \\nconnection with their home or workplace. Keeping the same in mind  \\nthe Transport department  has carried out a scientific  route \\nrationalisation stu dy and worked out an extensive set of last -mile \\nconnectivity routes that will connect all the major nodes of Delhi‘s \\nmetro and bus network with residential colonies, commercial \\ncomplexes and habitations across Delhi. I take pride in announcing \\nthat, for th e first time in the history of Delhi, a dedicated last -mile \\nconnectivity scheme called ―mohalla bus‖ scheme will be launched \\nin Delhi next year. Only smaller electric buses of 9m length will be \\ndeployed on these routes. The fare collection mechanism in the se \\nbuses will be integrated with the rest of the public transport system \\nthrough the common mobility card or One Delhi card. Starting with 18 \\n 100 fully electric ―mohalla buses‖ in the coming year, a total of 2180 \\n―mohalla buses‖ will ply on the city roads in the next 3 years to fix \\nthis critical gap in last -mile connectivity in Delhi.  \\n \\n47. The anticipated expenditure for this massive induction plan of \\nElectric buses over the next 12 years is ₹ 28,556 Crores. I propose \\nan allocation of ₹ 3,500 Crores for Delhi Gove rnment bus services \\ntowards the next financial year.  \\n \\n48. Sir, our objective is not just to augment the fleet of Delhi‘s buses but \\nalso modernize the entire public transport system in line with global \\nstandards of comfort, safety and security. Keeping in mind the \\nsafety of women passengers, all our new buses come factory -fitted \\nwith GPS, 3 CCTV cameras and 10 panic buttons, which operate in \\nreal-time communication with a state -of-the-art centralized \\nCommand and Control Centre operating out of Kashmere Gate. A \\nbus marshal has also been deployed in every bus to keep an eye on \\nany kind of safety incident in the buses.  \\n \\n49. Speaker Sir, as I said, our target is to convert 80% of the total buses \\nin Delhi into electric buses by 2025. So it is important that before the \\narrival of these buses, all bus depots in Delhi are electrified. This \\ninvolves a major upgradation in the upstr eam electricity grid, \\ndrawing high -tension power lines and setting up of sub -stations at \\neach of the bus depots. In this direction, we have started the work of \\nelectrification of all 57  bus depots in Delhi on a war footing. Out of \\nthis, 3 depots are already electrified and 17 bus depots will be \\nelectrified by June 2023. All 57 bus depots in Delhi will be electrified \\nby December 2023.  19 \\n  \\n       Delhi government will spend around ₹ 1500 Cror e on the \\nelectrification of bus depots . \\n \\n50. Speaker sir, the purpose of any public transport system is to serve its \\ncommuters. If the goal is to attract all sections of society to use \\npublic transport, then the comfort, convenience and overall \\nexperience of the commuters using public transport system becomes \\nparamount. I am thrilled to announce that Delhi‘s public transport \\ninfrastructure is all set to be modernized with world class facilities in \\nthe coming year. Following are the key projects that will be ta ken by \\nDelhi government in this regard:  \\n \\n● First, development of 3 world -class ISBTs will be taken up. The \\nISBTs at Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan along with RRTS and \\nRailway station nearby  cater to lakhs of people daily. Delhi \\ngovernment has partnered with  DMRC to redevelop these two ISBTs \\nthrough PPP model with top class amenities at par with airports. So \\nthese redeveloped ISBTs can very well be called ―Bus Ports‖. \\nBesides providing a host of amenities to commuters, these Bus Ports \\nshall also have commerci al complexes that will also help generate \\nemployment for people.  \\n \\n       Delhi government will also be developing a new world -class ISBT at \\nDwarka with a similar vision.  \\n \\n● Second, Delhi will soon have two unique multi -level bus depots at \\nHari Nagar and Vasant Vihar. Being developed in partnership with \\nNBCC, these will be first multi -level bus depots anywhere in India, \\nand where buses can be parked up to 6 levels. Besides increasing \\nthe capacity of bus parking, these multi -level depots will also offer 20 \\n prime commercial space to further boosting our economic activity \\nand generating employment.  \\n \\n● Third, keeping in mind the convenience and comfort of the domestic \\nbus commuters, Transport department has decided to construct two \\nmodern bus terminals in collaborat ion with DMRC at Nehru place \\nand Najafgarh. The remaining bus terminals shall also be renovated \\nsoon along these lines in the coming years.  \\n \\n● Fourth, construction of 9 new bus depots is in full swing and same \\nshall be completed in the next year. This will d rastically expand the \\ntotal capacity of buses that can run in Delhi.  \\n \\n51. Speaker Sir, along with this historic modernisation of Delhi‘s bus \\nsystem, we will also be constructing 1400 new and modern Bus \\nQueue Shelters (BQS) across Delhi. Besides providing a comfortable \\nwaiting area for bus commuters, these bus shelters will also have a \\nstatic display of bus routes and digital screens displaying the  arrival \\ntime of buses. In view of the G20 Summit being held in Delhi, we will \\ncomplete this work in a phase wise  manner.  \\n \\n52. Yamuna ji  is the lifeline of Delhi. It holds a deep significance in our \\nculture and religious beliefs. Therefore, any vision to develop Delhi \\ninto a ‗clean, beautiful and modern city‘ must put the cleaning and \\nrejuvenation of Yamuna at the forefront. Building on th e multiple \\nefforts initiated in the last 8 years, Delhi government is working on a \\n6-point action plan to clean the Yamuna which includes the following \\ncomponents:  \\n \\n● First:  Construction of new STPs/DSTPs and Upgradation  of \\nexisting STPs - The government aims to further increase the 21 \\n sewage treatment capacity by 258 MGD in the year 2023 -24. As a \\nresult, the total sewage treatment capacity of Delhi Jal Board will \\nbe increased from 632 MGD to 890 MGD by the end of March \\n2024 - a huge 41% rise in capacity in a single year.       \\n \\n● Second:  Sewer connectivity up to 100% households - Under the \\nChief Minister\\'s Free Sewer Connection Scheme, the Delhi \\ngovernment is providing free household sewer connections to the \\npeople in unauthori sed colonies. Under this scheme, sewer networks \\nwill be set up in 570 unauthorized colonies in the next year to ensure \\nconnectivity to all sewer connections. Domestic sewer connections \\nwill also be provided free of cost to all the residents in all these \\ncolonies. Total number of colonies with sewer connectivity will \\nincrease from 747 to 1317 (i.e. from 41% to 73% of all colonies) in \\nthis financial year. It is important to note that until 2014, only 227 \\ncolonies (i.e. only 13% of all colonies) in Delhi were connected with \\nthe sewer network.  \\n \\n● Third:  Desilting of sewer network - Under this, desilting of 90 km trunk \\nand peripheral sewer lines will be done.  \\n \\n● Fourth:  Trap and divert drains - Under this, drains will be trapped and \\ndiverted from JJ clusters and connected to the main sewer network.  \\n \\n● Fifth:   Industrial units causing pollution will be shifted to conforming \\nareas.  \\n \\n● Sixth:   Trapping of major drains to reduce pollution in River Yamuna: \\nSub drains of 3 major drains including Najafgarh drain, \\nSupplementary drain and Shahdara drain are being trapped. Other \\nremaining major drains which are outfalling in River Yamuna are also \\nbeing trapped.  22 \\n  \\n53. Due to the combined impact of the six -point action plan to Clean \\nYamuna, the quantity of sewage being treated in Delhi will increase \\ndrastically from 373 MGD in 2015 to nearly 890 MGD by March 2024 \\n- an increase by nearly 250% in just eight ye ars. \\n \\n54. Speaker sir, the final and one of the most important components of \\nour plan for transforming Delhi into a ‗clean, beautiful and modern \\ncity‘ deals with the three garbage mountains of Delhi. It is unfortunate  \\nfor, the National Capital that the erstwhile three municipal \\ncorporations (South, East and North MCD) were consistently ranked \\nin the bottom 10 of the Swacch Bharat ranking. And a big reason for \\nthat were the three massive garbage mountains. Although efforts \\nhave been underw ay to clear these garbage mountains for a few \\nyears, some estimates suggest that it will take 197 years to clear \\nthese garbage mountains at the current pace. This is simply \\nunacceptable.  \\n \\n55. Thanks to the efforts of Hon‘ble Chief Minister, Delhi government ha s \\njoined hands to work together with the MCD. We will work hand in \\nhand with the MCD and provide them whatever support necessary to \\nensure that we see the end of all three garbage mountains within two \\nyears, starting with the closure of Okhla landfill by D ecember 2023, \\nBhalaswa landfill by March 2024 and Ghazipur landfill by December \\n2024. To help make Delhi a clean, beautiful and modern Delhi,  I \\npropose a loan of ₹ 850 Crores to the MCD in the financial year \\n2023 -24. \\n 23 \\n       Speaker sir, clearing these garbage mountains by the MCD may \\nseem tough, but we are determined to show Delhi the result of our \\nefforts.  \\n \\n      At this point, a verse seems apt:  \\n \\nJo kaamyaabi haasil karne ka junoon rakhte hai,  \\nVe samandar par bhi patthar ka pul bana dete hain.  \\n \\n56. Sir, I am confident that the plan outlined above is the most \\ncomprehensive and ambitious effort till date to make Delhi a ‗clean, \\nbeautiful and a modern city‘ - which can be a source of pride for all \\nIndians as well as a beacon of h ope and possibilities for all big cities \\nacross India.       \\n \\nSECTORAL PROPOSALS 2023 -24 \\n \\nEDUCATION  \\n \\n57. Speaker Sir, I want to now place a few major proposals related to the \\nEducation Sector.  \\n \\n      Speaker Sir, e very individual, every family, every state, every nation \\nis working hard to be prosperous. Governments around the globe are \\nlaunching new initiatives, new innovations  and programmes for \\npeace with the common ultimate goal to support their citizens to \\nbecome prosperous. Hon‘ble Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Ji has \\nconsidered education as the highway to the prosperity of every \\nhuman being. The Chief Minister has appealed to the people of \\nentire Delhi that if they want their families to be successful, if they \\nwant to make their children successful, all  they have to do is to give \\nthem a good education. And to give them a good education in Delhi, 24 \\n they need not spend a lot of money. Delhi government is committed \\nto providing quality education to our children and has proved it by \\ndoing all that it has promi sed in the last 8 years.  \\n \\n58. Arvind Kejriwal Ji‘s E ducation Model has now gone a long way \\nbeyond just building good government school buildings and getting \\ngood results in exams. The Delhi government has allocated the \\nhighest budget for education every year. Our schools have excellent \\nfacilities and we have also int roduced the best international and \\nnational level standards of training  for teachers. Today, it is a matter \\nof pride for every Indian that whenever there is any discussion on \\nexcellence in the government schooling system around the world, the \\nexample of Delhi Government schools is always cited first. No one \\ncould have ever im agined that a prestigious international newspaper \\nlike the New York Times would profile the successes of Delhi \\nGovernment schools on its front page, along with the photo of India‘s \\nfinest education minister.  \\n \\n59. Speaker Sir, not only for Delhi but also India and possibly for the \\nentire world, this academic session of 2022 -23 has been the first \\nnormal academic session that proceeded without any hindrance \\nsince the horror of the Covid -19 pandemic. No government and \\neducation system of the world has been able to completely evade its \\neffects on the education of its children. But I would like to say with \\npride that the steps taken by the Kejriwal government before 2020 \\nprovided us with the base with which we could reduc e the \\neducational loss of our children even in these adverse \\ncircumstances.  \\n 25 \\n 60. In a nutshell we can say that, with the help of technology, \\nmindfulness practice of meditation and support of parents and \\nteachers, our children not only kept stress under control  but also \\nremained connected with education throughout the Corona period. \\nThey performed brilliantly in board exams, engineering and medical \\nentrance examinations. Speaker Sir, the proof of this resilience is \\nthat we achieved 98% results in 12th class. In addition, 493 children \\ncould qualify in JEE Mains and 648 in NEET.  \\n \\n61. I am glad to share that 56 students out of the first batch of 12th class \\nstudents of Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum proved their mettle \\nin entrepreneurial abilities through Business B lasters initiative and \\ngot direct admissions in courses like BBA and B.Tech in top 7 \\nuniversities of the Delhi Government. I am sure not only will these \\nchildren create a new dimension for themselves but the country\\'s \\nhigher education will also get a new p urpose through this \\nexperiment.  \\n \\n62. Similarly, the Deshbhakti Curriculum implemented from 2021 is also \\ntraining our children to see every Indian from the perspective of \\nhumanity rather than through the prism of caste and religion. This \\ncurriculum is giving pr actical training to our children to truly \\nunderstand and fulfill their responsibilities towards the country.  \\n \\n63. The year 2022 -23 has been remarkable for Delhi education in many \\nother respects. Delhi\\'s first residential Armed Forces Preparatory \\nSchool, dedicated to Shaheed -e-Azam Bhagat Singh,  was \\ninaugurated at Jhadoda village, Najafgarh. Currently, 160 children \\nare studying in this school who will soon join the armed forces and 26 \\n serve the motherland. In addition to this , the first batch of Delhi \\nModel Virtual School - the country\\'s first virtual school in true sense - \\nstarted its journey with a batch of students fro m 14 states including \\nGoa, Karnataka, Odisha, Kerala, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya \\nPradesh etc.    \\n \\n64. Speaker sir, training of teachers and principals is an integral part of \\nthe Kejriwal government\\'s education model. We have sent 98 \\nprincipals to IIM Ahmed abad for training this year, while 56 of our \\nprincipals and teacher educators went to Cambridge for leadership \\ntraining. If political narrow mindedness had not come in the way, 60 \\nprimary teachers in -charge would have also been trained in Finland\\'s \\nworld -class early childhood and primary schooling model. I am proud \\nto say that during the tenure of the Kejriwal government, 1410 \\nprincipals, teachers and teacher educators have received training in \\nFinland, Singapore and Cambridge. In the history of our country , no \\ngovernment would have conducted international training of teachers \\nand principals on such a large scale. Till date, 1247 of our principals \\nhave also taken training from IIM Ahmedabad and 61 principals from \\nIIM Lucknow. At this point, I would also like  to mention that along \\nwith foreign countries, we have sent our teachers to different states \\nfrom Tripura to Gujarat and from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu to study and \\nunderstand the unique models of education.  \\n  \\n65. Speaker sir, since the formation of the Kejriwal g overnment in 2015 \\ntill date, we have appointed 24,144 teachers through direct \\nrecruitment. Such a huge recruitment drive in such a short time \\nperiod has never happened in any of the states  \\n 27 \\n 66. Speaker Sir, we will continue the same spirit of excellence and \\ninnovation in education in the coming financial year 2023 -24 through \\nmultiple new schemes and programs. As I had said earlier, giving \\ntablets to all teachers in the year 2018 was a far -sighted step. \\nRealizing the importance of this step, I propose that as  the previous \\ntablets are now more than four years old,  we will  provide new \\ntablets to all our teachers (including regular, guest and contractual), \\nvice principals, principals and DDEs. Along with this, we will also \\nprovide at least 20 new computers in e very school in a phased \\nmanner so that new concepts as well as learning assessments can \\nbe taught with the help of these devices. In the year 2023 -24, we will \\nmake these devices available in 350 schools.  \\n \\n67. Dr. Ambedkar Schools of Specialized Excellence (SoS E) started with \\n20 schools in 2021. We will now increase it to 37 in the coming year. \\nNow about 10,000 children will be able to study in them. Our target is \\nthat every child of Delhi who has a specialized talent should be able \\nto get admission in a SoSE  nearest to his/ her home. All these \\nschools will be affiliated by the Delhi Board of School Education.  \\n \\n68. Since the specializations in SoSE are designed keeping in mind the \\nglobal environment, we are also teaching French, German, Japanese \\nand  Spanish language s to the children in these schools. Based on \\nthe learnings from this pilot project, we will consider rolling it out to all \\nschools in the coming years.  \\n \\n69. I am happy to share that 676 children of the first batch of STEM \\n(Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ematics) specialization \\nunder SoSE will appear for the 12th board examination conducted by \\nthe Delhi Board of School Education.  Of these children, 253 students 28 \\n of STEM specialization who appeared for JEE Mains, nearly 50% i.e \\n114 have qualified for JEE  Advanced.  \\n \\n70. Speaker sir, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, for the \\nfirst time in the country, schools and industries will collaborate \\ntogether. The Kejriwal  Govt. has commenced 12 new Schools of \\nApplied Learning to build a better future for our children. These \\nschools will not only have traditional subjects but will also have a \\nprofessional industrial setup to provide adequate exposure to the \\nstudents to deve lop their skills. These Schools of Applied Learning \\nwill be affiliated to the Delhi Board of School Education. High quality \\nskill subjects will also be compulsorily introduced in these schools \\nfrom standard 9th. Every child will study 3 skills subjects eac h in \\nstandard 9th and 10th and 1 skill subject each in standard 11th and \\n12th. The aim of this approach is that along with traditional subjects, \\nevery child should also learn such skills which will prepare him/her \\nfor new age jobs. We believe that in the c oming times Delhi \\nGovernment Schools of Applied  Learning will be able to present a \\ncomprehensive model of education encompassing knowledge, skills \\nand attitude.  \\n \\n71. Sir, we all know that Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools are \\nfeeder schools of Delhi Gove rnment. Every year around 180,000 \\nchildren from these schools take admission in 6th class in Delhi \\ngovernment schools. In 2016, we found that 76% of Class 6 children \\ncould not even read their textbooks. Through ‗Chunauti‘ and ‗Mission \\nBuniyaad‘ programs of  the Delhi Government, we tried to enhance \\nreading, writing and basic arithmetic abilities of children. This cycle \\ngoes on every year. Therefore, from this year, we will work on the 29 \\n idea of a school complex suggested in the National Education Policy \\n2020. Delhi government schools will take all their feeder schools and \\nAnganwadis of the area along with them so that the foundational \\nskills of all children can be improved and when the child joins a Delhi \\ngovernment school in  standard 6, they have the learning  ability \\naccording to their grade.  \\n \\n72. The Delhi Government has developed numerous state -of-the-art \\nsports complexes in the last five years including International Sports \\nComplex in Kair (Najafgarh), Mundhela Sports Complex and \\nPehladpur  Sports Complex. Some projects in the pipeline include a \\nwrestling hostel and relaying of synthetic tracks at Chhatrasal \\nStadium, upgradation of Rajiv Gandhi stadium and construction of \\nsquash center at Thyagraj stadium. In future the Government plans \\nto develop a multipurpose sports complex at Samaspur Khalsa in \\nNajafgarh for which 35 acres of land has already been allocated. In \\nthe last 8 years, the government through its various schemes to \\nencourage sports persons has disbursed an amount of Rs. 110 \\nCrore s approximately to more than 9,000 players.  \\n \\n73. Sir, I propose an outlay  of ₹16,575 Crore in the Education Sector for \\nthe financial year 2023 -24.  \\n \\nENVIRONMENT  AND  FOREST  \\n \\n74. Speaker Sir, I want to now place a few major proposals related to the \\nEnvironment and Forest Department.  \\n \\n      The Atharvaveda mentions ― माता भूममिः पुत्रोऽहं  पृमिव्ािः । ― [Transliteration: \\nmātā bhūmiḥ putro‘haṃ pṛthivyāḥ] which means that ―Earth is my 30 \\n mother and I am her child‖. Delhi Government, under the leadership \\nof the Hon‘ble  Chief Minister , has taken all efforts over the last 8 \\nyears to ensure that we treat the nature and environment of Delhi the \\nway we treat our mother – with love and care, and with a desire to \\nensure that she lives forever.        \\n \\n75. I am happy to inform the House that, thanks to the hard work of the \\nDelhi government and the people of Delhi, the efforts made in the \\nlast 8 years have started showing spectacular results. The presence \\nof PM -10 in the air of Delhi was 324 PPM in the year 2014, which \\nhas come down to 223 PPM in 2022. Similarly, the presence of PM -\\n2.5 in Delhi\\'s air was 149 PPM  in 2014, which has come down to 103 \\nPPM in 2022. The concentration of both PM -10 and PM -2.5 have \\nreduced by more than 30% in the last 8 years. From these figures it \\nis clear t hat compared to 2014, the pollution in Delhi‘s  air      has \\nreduced by 30%.  \\n \\n76. The number of days with ―Severe‖ air quality has also come down \\ndrastically over the past few years — from 26 days in 2016 to 6 days \\nin 2022. During this period, the number of days with good to \\nmoderate air quality has also increased to 163 as compared to 109. \\nThis shows that due to the efforts of the Delhi government and the \\npeople of Delhi, the number of good days has started increasing \\nnow.  \\n \\n77. The campaign to increase the fores t cover on a war footing by the \\nDelhi government has made a major contribution in the visible \\nsuccess in fighting pollution. Today Delhi has per capita forest cover \\nof 11.6 square meters which is more than any other mega cit y in the 31 \\n country. Compared to De lhi, Hyderabad  has per capita forest cover \\nof 10.6 , Bengaluru 10.4 , Mumbai 6.0, Chennai 2. 6 and Kolkata \\n0.1square meters.  \\n \\n78. Speaker Sir, the progress Delhi has made in the fight against \\npollution has not happened overnight  but is the result of continuous \\nfocus and hard work of the government. Last year the government \\nprepared a 15 point winter action plan. Under this, a green war room \\nwas created to coordinate the actions of 27 agencies/departments \\nleading the fight against pollution by identifying dust, ga rbage \\nburning and other pollution hotspot areas. The government also \\ndeployed 84 mechanised road sweeping machines, 609 sprinklers \\nand 639 anti -smog guns during the winter months to control air \\npollution. More than 90% of all the complaints raised by the c itizens \\nthrough the Green Delhi App were resolved. Our government has \\nalso set a new benchmark for strengthening the data related to air \\npollution by commissioning a modern lab for real -time identification of \\ndifferent causes of pollution. With the lab, es tablished in collaboration \\nwith IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi and TERI, the government has started \\ngetting information on exact time and causes of  pollution.  \\n \\n79. Speaker Sir,  we still have a long way to go in the fight against \\npollution. Keeping this in mind, along with continuing the above \\nmeasures, I would like to announce the new steps that the \\ngovernment will take in the financial year 2023 -24. \\n \\n80. We will take the real time source apportionment project to the next \\nlevel by setting up 11 mobile vans (one in each dis trict) to go across \\nDelhi       32 \\n  \\n81. Taking a major step towards reducing road dust, the government has \\ndecided to keep all the 1400 kilometer long PWD roads clean, not \\nleaving the footpaths and central verges broken anywhere and \\nplanting grass, shrubs and tree s in the empty spaces. The \\ngovernment has made an important plan to plant trees, sprinkle \\nwater on the roads and wash the roads regularly through modern \\nmachines, which I have already mentioned.  \\n \\n82. The government will intensify its mega tree plantation drive  next year \\nby planting 52 lakh trees in the city. We will also continue to work on \\npolicies to improve the city -forests that come under the jurisdiction of \\nthe Delhi Government, so that these forests can become a part of the \\nnormal life of our citizens and  prove to be important in increasing \\ntheir awareness towards the environment.  \\n \\n83. I am sure with these efforts, Delhi will not just be preserving the \\nforest cover but will be increasing the number of trees in the city. \\nEach new tree will help the citizens of Delhi to breathe cleaner air in \\ncoming years.  \\n \\nHEALTH  \\n \\n84. Speaker Sir, a long with Education, the Health sector is the second \\nmost crucial pillar of the Delhi Model. In the last eight years, keeping \\nthe people of Delhi healthy and attending to their minor ailments to \\nmajor ones, has been at the centre of Delhi Government‘s appr oach \\nto public health.  \\n 33 \\n 85. Many people will recall that in Delhi, before 2015, in the name of \\nprimary health care, there used to be poorly maintained dispensaries \\nwhich had neither doctors nor medicines. Today, standing in 2023, I \\nwould like to give you a glimpse of how Delhi\\'s heal th infrastructure \\nhas improved. Under the leadership of Honorable Chief Minister \\nArvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government has 515 Aam Aadmi Mohalla \\nClinics, 4 Mahila Mohalla Clinics, 175 allopathic dispensaries, 60 \\nPrimary Urban Health Centers (PUHCs), 30 Pol yclinics and  39 Multi -\\nSpecialty  / Super Specialty Hospitals with a capacity of 14,244 beds \\nthat provide health care services to more than 4 Crore patients \\nannually.  \\n \\n86. Today our Mohalla clinics stand for excellence in primary healthcare, \\nwhere qualified MBB S doctors treat people with dignity and respect. \\nMore than 250 diagnostic tests and 165 essential medicines are \\navailable free of cost. The benefit of this is that about 2 Crore people \\nare coming to these Mohalla clinics for treatment annually. In the last  \\n8 years, we have worked hard to create such a robust health care \\nmodel on which the people of Delhi can trust and where people can \\ngo to get their treatment done with dignity.  Speaker Sir, w e have \\ndeveloped a plan to set up Mohalla Clinics at Metro stati ons so that \\nthe citizens of Delhi can easily get the health services they need.   \\n \\n87. Speaker Sir, last year we had taken a new initiative to enhance the \\nhealth services for women in Delhi by setting up Mahila Mohalla  \\nClinics. A study conducted by experts from India and Harvard \\nUniversity has revealed that only 37% of women visit OPDs for their \\ncommon ailments. To further understand the need of Delhi, the Delhi \\ngovernment also conducted a survey in which it was found t hat 51% 34 \\n women do not go to the doctor despite having symptoms. Our \\ngovernment had announced Mahila Mohalla Clinics in the last budget \\nand I am happy to say that under the guidance of Hon‘ble Chief \\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal Ji for the first time in the count ry, Mahila \\nMohalla Clinics were launched in Delhi. The Mahila Mohalla Clinic \\nhas a number of specialized services for women including cervical \\ncancer screening and immunization services for children under 12 \\nyears of age. We have 4 operational clinics and in the first four \\nmonths, more than 42,0 00 patients have come to Mahila Mohalla \\nClinics. In the next year, based on the experiences of existing 4 \\nclinics, we plan to open 100 Mahila Mohalla Clinics across the city.  \\n \\n88. Speaker Sir, in modern medical science, the correct treatment of a \\nperson\\'s disease is directly dependent on whether the diagnostic \\ntests are conducted properly or not.  In the absence of appropriate \\ntests, the disease becomes severe and after that it is impossible to \\ncontrol it. One of the biggest secrets to the success of the Mohalla \\nClinics has been that apart from having doctors and medicines, the \\nbest labs of the coun try provide more than 250 types of tests free of \\ncost. Enthused by this, the government has now decided to conduct \\n450 types of free tests such as HCV Genotyping, Antibody Titre etc. \\nin mohalla clinics as well as in other medical institutions like primary \\ndispensaries, polyclinics, and hospitals through government \\nauthorized agencies similar to that provided in Mohalla Clinics.  \\n \\n89. Under the leadership of Hon‘ble Chief Minister Delhi Gov ernment is \\nworking on a fast track mode to build 9 new government hospital s in \\nareas such as Jwalapuri, Madipur, Shalimar Bagh , Hastsal, Siraspur, \\nSarita Vihar, Raghubir Nagar, Sultanpuri and Kirari  four of which will 35 \\n be operational in the next financial year. Along with this, work has \\nalso begun for the remodeling and extension  of 15 hospitals, \\nincluding Chacha Nehru Bal Vidyalaya, GTB .  \\n \\n       With all these efforts, the number of beds available for patients in \\nDelhi government hospitals will increase from 14,000 to \\napproximately 30,000.  \\n \\n90. Work is underway on important projects  like Health Information \\nManagement System and Health Card in Delhi. Through the HIMS \\nand Health Card system, the people of Delhi will be able to go to any \\ngovernment  hospital for treatment without carrying their old records.  \\n \\n91. Since its inception in 2017, ‗Delhi Arogya Kosh ‘ Scheme has become \\none of the most important schemes of Kejriwal government‘s health \\nmodel . Under  this scheme, if a person is not able to get treatment \\ndue to a long wait period for operation, scanning or implant etc. in a \\ngovernment hospital, the patient can then be treated in empanelled \\nprivate hospitals for which the government will bear the entire  cost. In \\nthe last five years, more than 5  lakh citizens have taken advantage of \\nthe Kejriwal government\\'s \"Delhi Arogya Kosh\" scheme.  \\n \\n92. Sir, I propose a n outlay of ₹ 9,742 Crore in the Health Sector for the \\nfinancial year 2023 -24.  \\n \\nTRANSPORT  \\n \\n93. Speaker Sir, I want to now place a few major proposals related to the \\nTransport Sector . \\n \\n       I have already mentioned the importance of last -mile connectivity for \\nany public transport system and the launch of the new ―mohalla bus‖ 36 \\n scheme next year. Keeping in mind the importance of providing \\nmultiple options for last mile connectivity, 4261 LOIs for Electric \\nAutos have been issued by the Transport Department last year. \\nAdditionally, Delhi Government has announced electric scooter \\nsharing service in Dwarka under which 1,500 e -scooters will be \\ndeployed at 250 high footfall locations such as Metro stations, bus \\ndepots, markets, malls and educational institutions as a mode for \\nlast-mile connectivity. The Delhi government will soon be sta rting this \\nservice in the next few months.  \\n \\n94. Delhi was the first state to launch the scheme of free travel for \\nwomen in Delhi Government buses. I am pleased to inform the \\nHouse that within a span of 3.5 years, more than 100 Crore trips \\nhave been completed by women free of cost in Delhi‘s buses.  Along \\nwith providing safety, security and comfort, I am sure that this \\nscheme has also increased the participation of women in the \\nworkforce and opened up new gateways of education for many of \\nthem. We will continue  this facility in the financial year 2023 -24 to \\npromote women empowerment in Delhi.  \\n \\n95. Yet another step taken by our Government last year to empower \\nwomen in Transport was to bring women to the forefront by \\nappointing them as DTC Bus drivers. I feel extremely proud to say \\nthat as of today, we have 34 women drivers plying 12 meter long \\nDTC buses in Delhi. It is one of the highest women participation as \\nDrivers in any Transport Corporation in India. We will not stop at this \\nmilestone;  we aspire to have one Bus Depot operated completely by \\nwomen, right from having driver, conductor, Marshalls and complete \\nstaff. I am sure we will achieve it soon.  37 \\n  \\n96. Speaker Sir, Delhi\\'s own all in one public mobility app \"One Delhi \\nApp\" was launched in November 2022. It gi ves convenience to the \\npeople traveling in the buses to track the buses in real time, know \\nthe exact waiting time of the next bus arriving at any bus stop and \\nbuy contactless tickets at discounted prices in the buses. Apart from \\nthis, it also helps people to search from more than 2300 EV \\ncharging points and battery swapping stations across Delhi and find \\nthe nearest one. Users can also register their complaints regarding \\nbuses and EV chargers through this app.  \\n \\n97. Speaker sir, Delhi EV policy 2020, which is completing its 3 years in \\nAugust 2023, has resulted in Delhi becoming the EV Capital of India . \\nThe Delhi Government has left no stone unturned to promote electric \\nvehicles through a 360 degree awareness campaign, offering \\ndifferent kinds of incentives to EV buyers and setting up a city wide \\nnetwork of EV charging infrastructure. Hon‘ble speaker sir, I believe \\nthe real credit for making this EV policy a big success goes to \\nDelhites who have open heartedly adopted electric  vehic les, despite \\nthis being a new technology. Since the launch of EV policy, Delhi has \\nregistered 1.04 lakh electric vehicles. In the month of December \\n2022, 16.7% of the total vehicles sold in Delhi were electric, which is \\nthe highest ever in the country. To encourage the purchase of EVs, \\nthe government has distributed more than Rs. 145 Crores of EV \\nsubsidy till now.  \\n \\n98. I would  also like to announce that the Delhi Government will soon roll \\nout the App Based Premium Bus Aggregator Scheme , which will \\nallow private  bus operators to offer app -based premium AC buses 38 \\n based on routes based on public demand . This will encourage the \\nprivate vehicle users to shift to public transport and further help \\nreduce pollution in Delhi. In addition  to this, the Delhi Government \\nwill soon launch the Delhi Moto r Vehicle Aggregator and Delivery \\nService Provider Scheme.   \\n \\n99. Faceless services : Under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal ji, as \\non date, 45 services of the Transport Autho rity (RTO) are being \\noffered through faceless mode. I a m pleased to inform this august \\nHouse that till December 2022, 35.19 lakh faceless applications have \\nbeen processed. No other state in India has launched a faceless  \\nservices initiative of this scale and magnitude. It is a matter of pride \\nthat other states are now following the path set by Delhi for faceless \\ntransport services.  \\n \\n100. Speaker Sir, to completely eliminate corruption and increase public \\nconvenience to access transport services, our government had \\nauthorized dealers to issue the RC to the vehicle buyer at the \\nshowroom itself. I am pleased to inform this House that till date, more \\nthan 8 lakh vehicle buyers have been issued RCs at the showroom \\nitself without visiting any office of the Transport Department. Speaker \\nsir, Delhi will soon become the fir st state to extend this facility to \\nbuyers of commercial vehicles as well.  \\n \\n101. Speaker Sir, Road Safety is extremely important in a city. Delhi \\ngovernment has taken multiple efforts over the years to make Delhi‘s \\nroads and road users safe. Automated Driving Test Tracks was an \\ninitiative in this direction, ensuring a user has to pass key skill tests \\nbefore getting a Permanent Driving License. I am glad to share that 39 \\n all the 13 driving test tracks in Delhi have been automated . Now \\nDelhi has no Manual Driving Test tracks at all - making Delhi the first \\nstate in the country to achieve this  milestone.  \\n \\n102. I propose a n outlay of ₹ 9,337 Crore in the Transport Sector for the \\nfinancial year 2023 -24. \\n \\nLABOUR  \\n \\n103. Speaker Sir, i t is a known fact that apart from businessmen, traders \\nand shopkeepers, lakhs of labourers working in Delhi have \\nsignificantly contributed in taking Delhi to new heights. From laying \\neach brick of the new Sansad Bhawan to building bridges, roads, \\ndrains, p arks for us, to working in various institutions, labourers \\nworking in Delhi are an important and irreplaceable part of Delhi\\'s \\nlife. That\\'s why, after coming to power in Delhi, one of the key steps \\nthat Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ji took was to increas e the \\nminimum wages for both the skilled and unskilled workers of Delhi      \\n. And I am proud that  today a skilled and an unskilled Labourer in our \\nDelhi gets the highest minimum wage in the country. For the \\nLabourers working in Delhi, the Labour Department  has fixed the \\nminimum wage for unskilled workers at ₹ 16,792/ - per month, for \\nsemi -skilled workers at ₹ 18,499/ - and for skilled workers at ₹ \\n20,357/ - per month, neighbouring states of  Delhi, Haryana has \\nminimum wages for unskilled labourers @ ₹ 10,243/ - per month, \\nwhereas Uttar Pradesh has minimum wages for unskilled labourers \\n@ ₹ 9,743/ - per month.  \\n 40 \\n 104. And the advantage of this is that when a labourer earns more \\nwages, he has more money to spend in the market. So, when there \\nis more money in the hands of m illions of Labourers to spend, it \\nincreases the demand in the economy. This further leads to an \\nincrease in the production in the country, which creates more jobs.  \\n \\n105. The Delhi government sees the Construction workers working in \\nDelhi as builders and creator s of Delhi and has constantly \\nprotected their interests. During the Corona period, Delhi \\ngovernment had given relief amounting to ₹ 258 Crore to about 3 \\nlakh construction workers under the ―Delhi Building and Other \\nConstruction Workers Welfare Board‖ at ₹ 5000 per person in 3 \\ninstallments . Last winter, the livelihood of 5.4 lakh construction \\nworkers was affected due to the stoppage of construction activity \\nduring the peak of pollution. During this period also, the \\ngovernment gave a relief of ₹5000 per const ruction worker, \\namounting to ₹ 270 Crore.  \\n \\n106. The Delhi government is currently running 17 welfare schemes for \\nconstruction workers such as maternity benefits, education benefits, \\nhealth benefits, accident benefits, death and pension benefits etc. \\nAlong with this, the government is going to start 4 new schemes for \\nconstruction workers this year, which are:  \\n \\n● Skill Development: On -site skill training will be introduced for all \\nregistered construction workers working at construction sites. The \\ndepartment has set a target to train 2 lakh construction workers on \\nthe job through this scheme.  41 \\n ● Tool Kit Distribution Scheme: Under this scheme, at the end of each \\nskill development training programme, construction workers will be \\nprovided free toolkits on the basis of thei r requirement.  \\n● Doctor on Wheels: Under this scheme, free health check -ups will be \\nprovided at the construction site to all the registered construction \\nworkers.  \\n● Crèche at the construction site: Under this scheme, free crèche \\nfacilities will be provided to t he children of the construction workers at \\nthe construction site and one time nutritious meal will be provided to \\nthe children of all the construction workers working at the site.  \\n \\nREVENUE  \\n \\n107. Speaker Sir, I want to now place a few major proposals related to the \\nRevenue department.  \\n \\n         We have started various schemes respecting the faith and religious \\nbeliefs of the people of Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal ji, playing the role of a \\nson, has taken approx. 70,000 elders of Delhi  to major pilgrimage \\nsites across th e country under the \\'Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra \\nYojana\\'. Under this scheme, the Delhi government organise s free \\npilgrimage travel for elders to 15 places across religious faiths \\nincluding Ayodhya, Dawrkadheesh, Puri, Varanasi, Maa Vaishno \\nDevi Dham, Ajmer S harif, Rameshwaram, Shirdi, Tirupati Balaji, \\nAmritsar.  \\n \\n108. Keeping in mind the religious and cultural sentiments of lakhs of \\nPurvanchalis living in Delhi, the Kejriwal Govt since last 8 years \\nhas been celebrating Chhath  Puja festival with great pomp and \\nshow. I would like to inform this House that from around 100 42 \\n chhath ghats in 2014, the number of ghats has increased 10 times, \\ngoing to almost 1100, where all possible arrangements are made \\nby Delhi Government so that the  devotees can perform the rituals \\nin safe and secure environment without worrying about the basic \\namenities. Along with this, for the benefits of Kawariyas, our \\ngovernment organizes Kawar camps at 175 places in Delhi. \\nSimilarly, to make the people of Delhi  aware of the rich culture of \\nUttarakhand and to preserve it, the government organizes \\n‗Uttarayani Mahotsav‘ at about 100 places across Delhi. I propose \\nto continue all these schemes in the financial year 2023 -24 as well.  \\n \\n109. Speaker Sir, I want to tell this august house that due to the \\nunseasonal rains and storms in October 2021 and January 2022, \\nthere was heavy damage to the crops in Delhi. Understanding the \\npain of the farmers, the Hon\\'ble Chief Minister announced \\ncompensation for the loss of crops. At the rate of ₹ 20,000/ acre, \\nDelhi government has distributed  a total compensation of ₹ 45 \\nCrores in  two phases. Through this House, I want to  assure all the \\nfarmers  that the Kejriwal Government will always stand with you in \\ndifficult times.  \\n \\nWATER  \\n \\n110. Speaker  Sir, I want to now place a few major proposals related to the \\nWater Sector.  \\n \\n       Delhi Jal  Board is working in mission mode on two important aspects \\nfor the people of Delhi. First is the Clean Yamuna project which I \\nhave already described, and second is - 24x7 supply of clean water. \\nThe name of the country\\'s capital Delhi will shine on the inte rnational 43 \\n stage only when essential public services  are at par with international \\nstandards. That\\'s why Delhi Government is  continuously working in \\nmission mode on the plan of providing water pipeline and water \\nconnection to every house and ensuring 24 hou rs availability of \\nwater.  \\n \\n111. In order to fulfil this dream, the Delhi Jal  Board has ensured that a \\nnetwork of water pipelines has been laid in 1671 unauthorized \\ncolonies, which is almost 93% of the unauthorized colonies of Delhi. \\nIn 1630 out of 1671 unauthorized colonies, the water has been \\nreleased.  \\n \\n112. I would like to mention he re that in 2015, only 985 unauthorized \\ncolonies had water pipelines, which has now increased to 1671. In \\nthe last 8 years, the seemingly impossible task of laying about 5,138 \\nkilometre long pipelines across various colonies in Delhi has almost \\nbeen complet ed. More than 3000 water flow meters have been \\ninstalled to ensure smooth water supply and to manage the water \\nsupply on an equitable basis in different colonies. This work of \\ninstalling water flow meters was started in 2015, due to which it has \\nbecome eas ier for us to find out the area wise distribution of water \\nsupply, with wastage, if any.  \\n113. To ensure the availability of drinking water and to increase the water \\nsupply as per the requirement, various schemes are being worked \\nupon to achieve the goal of incr easing water availability from present \\n995 MGD to about 1240 MGD by March 2025.  \\n \\n114. Speaker Sir, in this mission of increasing the supply of water in Delhi, \\nthe Delhi Government is working on two levels – first is to increase 44 \\n the level of ground water and second is to harvest the rain water \\nflowing on the roads of Delhi during the rainy season. Also, \\nconserving the extra water available in the Yamuna under the ground \\nduring this period is a top priority. The pilot project of fl ood water \\nharvesting started in Palla in 2019 is recharging groundwater to the \\nextent of 800 -1000 MG per year during floods. Due to this, the \\nground water level of the related areas has increased by about 2 \\nmeters. In addition to recharging the excess wate r during the rains in \\nthe Yamuna, water recharge projects are underway across Delhi on \\na large scale. In the next financial year, 100 MGD water will be \\nrecharged daily through various lakes and other sources.  \\n \\n115. Water requirement in Delhi is for drinking pur poses as well as for \\nnon-drinking purposes like green belts, farmhouses, water bodies \\netc. The government is working to ensure that drinking water or \\ngroundwater should not be used for non -drinking purposes. The \\ngovernment desires that the water coming out  of the STPs should be \\nused majorly for non -drinking purposes and for this a large pipeline \\nnetwork is being set up by the government.  \\n \\n116. Under the flagship project of the Hon\\'ble  Chief Minister, the \\ncampaign to make Delhi a \\'City of Lakes\\' is also being implemented \\non a war footing. In a few months, our government will complete the \\nwork of reviving 20 big lakes. I am happy to inform you that the lakes \\ncreated at Dwarka STP have in creased the ground water level by 5.5 \\nmeters within a short span of one year. These lakes will be \\ndeveloped as open spaces for the public which will also provide \\nopportunities for recreation and tourism.  \\n 45 \\n 117. Delhi Jal Board has covered more than 28 lakh cons umers in its \\nrevenue network. The scheme of free 20,000 liters water per month \\nhas been availed by nearly 19 lakh individual consumers in the last \\nyear.  \\n \\n118. Speaker Sir, to provide clean drinking water even to the poorest \\nsection of the society, the Delhi government is going to set up 1000 \\nRO plants in JJ clusters, unauthorized colonies and water deficit \\nareas in this financial year. Through this, people living in such areas \\nwill get 24x7 clean water.  \\n \\n119. I propose a n outlay of ₹ 6,342 Crore in the Water Secto r for the \\nfinancial year 2023 -24. \\n \\nSOCIAL  SECURITY  AND  WELFARE  \\n \\n120. Sir, our government is working very actively for the social and \\neconomic welfare of senior citizens, women, differently -abled and \\ndisadvantaged sections. Through various schemes, pension ranging \\nfrom ₹ 2,000 to ₹ 2,500 per month is being given to 8.82 lakh  \\nbeneficiaries. I propose  an amount of ₹ 2,962 Crore for these \\nbeneficiaries in the year 2023 -24. \\n \\n121. I propose an amount of ₹ 4,744 Crore  for the Budget Estimates \\n2023 -24 for Social Welfare Department, Women and Child \\nDevelopment Department and SC/ST/OBC Welfare Department.  \\n \\nPOWER  \\n                     \\n122. Speaker Sir, t he Delhi government under the leadership of \\nHonorable Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Ji has treated providing 46 \\n minimum electricity to every household in Delhi like a right of the \\ncitizen. As soon as Kejriwal ji became the Chief Minister in 2015, \\nelectricity rates were halved in Delhi for households consuming less \\nthan 400 units of electricity per month. And after a few years, \\ncompletely free electricity was arranged for families who consumed \\nup to 200 units of electricity per month. This, in itself, was a \\nrevolutionary step. It is a matter of pride that in the year 202 2-23, out \\nof Delhi‘s 58.5 lakh domestic consumers, about 84% had availed the \\nDelhi government\\'s electricity subsidy scheme.  \\n \\n123. Speaker Sir, Delhi Government has made significant progress in the \\npower sector in the last 8 years. Delhi successfully met its peak \\npower demand  of 7,695 MW  on 29 June 2022 with zero load \\nshedding. I would like to inform the House that the electricity rates in \\nDelhi have not been increased in the last 8 years. Also, AT&C \\nLosses have also come down to  7%, which is among the lowest in \\nIndia.  \\n \\n124. In Dec ember 2022, the Delhi government notified the Draft Solar \\nPolicy of Delhi, which will establish Delhi as a leading example for \\nthe country in the field of solar energy. Delhi Solar Policy aims to \\nmeet 25% of Delhi\\'s annual electricity demand through solar energy \\nby 2025, which currently stands at 9%. To achieve this, the policy \\nhas set a target of installing solar infrastructure with a capacity of \\n6,000 MW by 2025, which will include 750 MW of ‗Roof Top Solar‘ \\n(RTS). The policy also aims to generate around 12,000 green jobs in \\nDelhi. The draft policy was shared with the public for their \\nsuggestions and comments. Based on the suggestions from the \\npublic, the Delhi government will notify the new policy by April 2023.  47 \\n  \\n125. Delhi Government has also made tremendous progress in making \\nDelhi\\'s power infrastructure ready for Electric Vehicles (EV). Delhi \\nTransco Limited (DTL), which is the state\\'s nodal agency for setting \\nup charging infrastructure in Delhi, is working efficiently to set up \\npublic charging stations for EVs. We often see that the slow \\nadoption of electric vehicles in cities around the world is due to the \\nlack of adequate charging stations. We are proud that the Delhi \\ngovernment today has come forward as an example for the world \\nby setting up EV charging s tations with the lowest charging tariffs.  \\n \\n126. Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) in the year 2022 -23 successfully \\ncompleted India‘s largest and first PPP tender for setting up EV \\ncharging stations. It includes setting up of 100 EV charging stations \\nhaving 900 EV cha rging points and 103 battery swapping stations. \\nThese are being set up at prime locations in Delhi, such as  around \\nmetro stations and bus depots. The minimum cost for EV charging is \\nonly ₹ 3 per unit. On calculating we find that the running cost of an \\nelectric two -wheeler is just 7 paisa per kilometer, while it is ₹ 1.75 per \\nkilometer for a petrol scooter. For an electric three wheeler, the cost \\nis  just 8 paisa per kilometer, while for a CNG three wheeler it  is ₹ \\n2.62 per kilometer. Meanwhile, the running  cost of a four -wheeler \\nelectric vehicle is just 33 paisa per kilometer, and around ₹ 7 for a \\npetrol -powered four -wheeler. This is nothing less than a revolution. \\nHon\\'ble Chief Minister has already inaugurated the first 11 of 100 EV \\ncharging stations in Oc tober  2022. Another 30 charging stations will \\nbe launched in March 2023 and rest in the financial year 2023 -24.  \\n 48 \\n 127. I propose an outlay  of ₹ 3,348 Crore in the Power Sector for the \\nfinancial year 2023 -24. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n [PART -B] \\nNow, I present part B of the Speech which deals with Revenue  \\n1. Hon\\'ble  Speaker Sir, in the first part of the Budget Speech, I have \\ndiscussed in detail the policies and schemes of the Government. Now, I \\nwill discuss the efforts being made to augment the revenue of the \\nGovernment.  \\n2.  The tax collection for GST and VAT in the year 2022 -23 (upto February, \\n2023) stood at ₹ 30283.62 crore, with an increase of 24.22 percent over \\nthe previous year (upto February 2022).  \\n3.   Sir, our Government has taken many measures to facilitate taxpayers \\nand to increase the revenue. In each tax w ard, we have initiated \\nMonthly Performance Monitoring with 18 Key Performance Indicators \\n(KPIs). The Department of Trade & Taxes is using GST Analytics and \\nIntelligence Network (GAIN)/ Business Intelligence and Fraud Analytics \\n(BIFA) and GST Portal extensi vely to effectively analyze and check Anti \\nEvasion activities through surveys/ inspection/ search and seizure.  \\nSimilarly, teams have also been activated on the Delhi Borders to check \\nunauthorised entry of vehicles and to impound them if found violating \\nGST Provisions.   \\n4.   At present, the Department of Trade & Taxes has started E -Invoicing \\nmandatory for those taxpayers whose aggregate turnover exceeds \\nRs.10 crore. In addition to this, regular analysis and follow up of top 200 \\ntaxpayers of each ward of Tr ade & Taxes is being done.  \\n 5.  Fake Firm Cell has been constituted as a new Ward 210 for curbing and \\nmonitoring the tax evasion by bogus/non -existent firms. It acts on the 50 \\n information/inputs on high mismatches, other State references, physical \\nverificatio n reports etc.  \\n6. Department has organised numerous out -reach programmes to \\naugment tax base by bringing eligible taxpayers who were hitherto \\noutside GST in the tax ambit. Around 200 meetings with market and \\nTrade Associations through Outreach Camps have h eld during the \\ncurrent Financial Year till date. The feedback from the ground shall \\nhelp in shaping future tax policies.  \\n7. The Software Application related to generation of DIN (Document \\nIdentification Number) which is a unique number used for \\nauthenticat ion of the documents issued by the Department and for \\nenabling the taxpayers to check the authenticity of the letters/orders \\nhas been developed and made operational in the Department from \\nJanuary, 2023.  Delhi is the Third State in the Country to implement  \\nit in the Indirect Tax Administration.  \\n8.   Sir, our government has intended to initiate Operationalization of a \\ndedicated Tax Policy and Revenue Augmentation Unit (TPRAU) in \\nthe next financial year 2023 -24. The Key objectives of this Unit is to \\nincrease revenue by identification of opportunities, detection of \\nrevenue leakages and support Department in Policy formulation.  \\n9.   Government is committed to augment excise revenue and regulate \\nthe commodity in a more effective manner ensuring no illicit liquor \\ntrade in Delhi by faceless enforcement & strengthening of Excise \\nIntelligence Bureau (EIB) and access of quality liquor all over Delhi.  \\n10. The Government has restored Excise duty based regime w.e.f. \\nSeptember, 2022. The hospitality industry i.e. Hotels, C lubs and 51 \\n Restaurants are significant contributors towards the improvement of \\nthe state\\'s overall economy by providing employment, tax generation \\nand promoting tourism. Government is working on developing new \\ntechnology to enhance and upgrade the existing t echnology of liquor \\nsupply management system.  \\n         Speaker sir, i want to end my budget speech with the popular poet   \\nAshok Sahil with the following lines:  \\n \\nNazar nazar mein uttarna kamaal hota hai,  \\nNafas nafas mein bikharna kamaal hota hai,  \\nBulandiyon par pahuchna koi kamaal nahi,  \\nBulandiyon par thaharna kamaal hota hai.  \\n  \\n**********************  '"
